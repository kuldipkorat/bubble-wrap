    answer:
      "Good question! For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level designer now exceeds $100,000, plus benefits (and good luck finding one available). Aside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep them busy at all times, so you're stuck paying for time you aren't able to utilize. With the monthly plan, you can pause and resume your subscription as often as you need to ensure you're only paying your designer when you have work available for them.",

      "Once subscribed, you're able to add as many design requests to your queue as you'd like, and they will be delivered one by one.",

    que: "How fast will I receive my designs?",
    answer:
      "On average, most requests are completed in just two days or less. However, more complex requests can take longer.",
